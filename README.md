# London Bikes Basic Analysis

### Mainly wanted to practice my pandas and matplotlib skills, so I used the tried and true London Bikes Dataset from Kaggle, which can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset/data

### The Notebook I created analyzes the dataset from different angles, looking at total bike counts from a monthly standpoint, a weather standpoint, and a weekly standpoint. I plan on doing more analysis in the future, and more in depth, as well.
#### I also hope to use this to create a machine learning model that can predict the number of total bikes numbers at any given moment, given the weather, the temperature, and the season.
